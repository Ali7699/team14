"Late Patients
Late patients are the patients with VT > PT. Once arrived, they should be 
added to a separate list. They must wait in the list for half of their late 
duration as a late penalty before being added to the appropriate waiting list.

BUT when adding them to a waiting list, place them sorted according to their 
actual PT + penalty.

Example:
--------
If PT = 10 and VT = 16, then the late penalty = (16 - 10) / 2 = 3.

At timestep 19 (16 + 3), the patient will leave the "Late" list and join a 
waiting list. They should be placed in a position where they precede all 
patients with PT > 13 (10 + 3)."


We input:
ID PT VT penalty Priority(=oldPT+pen) New PT(=VT+pen)
0  5  7  1       6                    8
1  2  7  2       4                    9
2  3  8  2       5                    10

Notice 0 has the lowest newPT, but will be held in line

hence, they should sort as, in format [ID,Pri]
[1,4],[0,6]

then at timestep =8, 2 enters:
[1,4],[2,5],[0,6]

then at =9, 1 leaves But 2 still holds 0 in line
[2,5],[0,6]
then finally at =10, both suddenly leave because 2 is no longer holding up the line
